has this ever happened to you you're learning about messaging for a project because you want to write some applications that need to communicate with each other but when you look for answers you find a load of buzzwords and jargon and no one seems to even want to agree what terms they should use for anything what does this sound familiar yeah hi i'm max from ibm mq and in this video i want to sort all of this out [Music] in this video i'm going to explain all the objects that you might need to think about to build the kind of awesome messaging solution that means you can do messaging in any environment you like in this video we're going to talk about event driven messaging we're going to talk about exactly what's messaging messaging endpoints how we build a messaging mesh and all the objects that you might need to use to connect your applications together in a reactive way then we're going to link all of that to the objects that you'll see and control when you use ibm mq so let's get into it so the first thing is messages


00:01:03
now messages are the objects that you send around to make stuff happen with mq they've got a payload which is the actual data that you want to send for example update this database or run this application it's got a descriptor which has control information that gets used to process that message and then they've got specific message properties which you can specify in your messaging app to get certain messaging behaviors for example you can set an expiry time for your messages so after a certain time they're not used messages can be set to be persistent which means that they're always highly available and resistant to failures when you use ibm mq in production we deal with persistence by replicating our endpoints as well as a few of the little things that happen in the background but the upshot of that is that it's really hard to lose important messages even if your system or your container or your cloud environment or your mainframe or anything else goes down now if you've got messages to send you're going to need a messaging endpoint somewhere to put them in mq we often use queues now this is where you put messages and they store your messages until you want to get them again


00:02:04
now because cue store messages they kind of act like a shock absorber to your whole architecture so it can all be decoupled and run asynchronously so what that means basically is that applications can put messages and they don't have to worry about if they're going to reach the destination if the app at the other end that needs to consume it is busy so the whole thing is decoupled now because you're putting one message on a queue and it gets consumed when you take it off at the other end this is called exactly once messaging or point-to-point messaging now say that your application wants to tell a bunch of other applications to do something now that's called an event-driven way of working when you want to make event driven applications that only do something when they get a message and you don't want the application that's sent the message to have to worry about who's going to consume it then you can use publish subscribe messaging to make super dynamic and super lightweight event driven applications now publish subscribe messaging is a programming pattern for building event driven decoupled applications what you basically do is you put


00:03:04
messages to something called a topic and those messages can be consumed by multiple receiving apps and your application that sent those messages doesn't have to know anything about those applications that are receiving the messages an example of where you'd actually use this kind of pattern is if you had an application that sends out flight status updates which go to passengers mobile apps and you don't have to worry about how many passengers have the app you just send out the flight updates now the next thing is the most important part of any solution that uses ibm mq and that is something called a queue manager now these are basically the brains of the system so they have the function of something like a server but for messaging so they host the cues and the topics and they work together to manage all of your messaging objects they're actually super lightweight and you can deploy them anywhere you want like in a container in any public cloud on a mainframe or even super hardware constrained environments like raspberry pi you can basically put them wherever you like when you have a large solution and one that's distributed in different locations on a network


00:04:05
it can be a really really good thing to have more than one endpoint and instead have a connected messaging infrastructure that we call a messaging mesh now if you've got a messaging mesh that means that you can put messages from an application to some endpoint and you know that those messages are going to end up in the right place wherever that might be now that's actually really easy to do with ibm mq so you can join up mq managers into an mq network which is distributed over your entire architecture now your applications then don't have to know anything about how the messages get to the destinations all they need to do is put a message to an endpoint and mq will sort out the rest of that for you an example of this is when a retailer has a queue manager working at the edge in each of their stores which communicate with queue managers in the cloud to send payment information and so on whenever a customer makes a purchase if you want to know how mq actually handles moving the messages around basically the message routing is handled by these things called channels


00:05:07
channels are objects that are used to send messages from place to place and how queue managers communicate with each other now because we want to make sure that all of our components are loosely coupled we need to make sure that our messaging solution that's connecting them all can deal with failures so if an endpoint or a queue manager goes down or if there's a massive surge in demand messages can still get sent now we do this in ibm mq through clustering now that's where we group together queue managers to work together and do some specific things like balancing application loads data replication or some queue managers might even wait on standby in case the active ones go down to take up that load and basically make sure the whole cluster is extremely highly available so the upshot of all of this is that you can build out a solution where you've got decoupled components and a super powerful messaging mesh between them but all you have to do as an application developer is put your messages to an endpoint and everything else is handled for you by mq so these are the things that we talked


00:06:07
about today and you can see we've covered quite a bit but the key takeaway is basically that a good messaging solution will join up all of your applications and it'll take care of all the stuff that's related to messaging for you so you can put all your messages to messaging endpoints like cues and topics and you can put your focus on writing the code that you want for your applications the final thing to mention is that the containers and cloud versions of mq have a free developer config that's preset and that basically means that lots of the objects we've talked about today are actually already created for you now if you're running mq somewhere else there's a link in the description so you can get those presets for yourself so you can use the developer config if you want to as well in the next video we're going to go into more depth into the messaging patterns so that's all the different ways that you can use messaging software in your applications to get awesome results if you're new to messaging we've got an mq badge course that you can take to help you make sense of it all don't get stuck like this poor guy have a look at it at the link here so that's the end of this video thank you so much for watching hopefully this

was helpful to you leave us a like if you learned something new and let us know what it was or what you'd like to see next in the comments thanks very much for watching and we'll see you next time [Music] cheers
