hello everyone so welcome back to another Wednesday talks on mainstream so this time it is on mq IBM mq so I will be giving you an overview of how IBM mq use used on the mainframe system by enter by giving an introduction and we will see some of the examples of how mq you used in a different domains and also I'll try to give some example using the Cobalt program or how a message queues are passed uh from mainframe system to a distributed system to a different distributed systems and so several things that I'll be sharing across in this video okay if you haven't subscribed to my channel so please do subscribe and share okay so let's get started so introduction to mq uh what is the IBM mq in general so IBM


00:01:04
chem queue is nothing but it's it's like a sending a message from one system to another system The Source system can be Mainframe or it can be any other system and the destination system can be a Mainframe or it can be any other Distribution Systems okay so it's it's simply I'm sending a message from one system to another system okay let's let's look at the definition ibmq is a messaging middleware that enables application to exchange messages in a reliable and secure way it provides a flexible and scalable messaging infrastructure that can be used to integrate application across different platforms and Technologies mq's is a software product that enables different applications running on different platforms to communicate with each other by exchanging messages let me give in a simple example suppose you are trying to play some order on an Amazon Okay so


00:02:06
maybe you you might be purchasing some iPhone okay and when you place an order some information is stored so it can be your name it can be a phone number uh some kind of a transaction payment transaction information or it can be an order okay let's take order right order what is the order you have placed iPhone right so how this iPhone will be shipped to your home address right so whatever the message so on the source computer let's say XYZ computer so this information is stored uh so so and so XYZ person has placed this and uh what is the order placed iPhone and that information has to be sent to the warehouse system or a can say warehouse computer where they check this information and based on that they package the item and they ship it to your home right so this message is


00:03:08
being sent to another system by using MP Q and mq make sure that message is is sent securely without any errors and it also has a capability to handle so many transactions which are in the queue why because it should be it is as I said like it is more reliable so whatever the uh sometimes like there would be a lot of transactions that it will be hitting on the purchase or maybe some Seasons right if there are any special offers so so ibmq can handle this queues are very secure and reliable way and I can say it's a safe way okay let me take another example of the banking system suppose you wanted to transfer a money from one account to another account suppose you have an HSBC account and you want to transfer from HSC Bank to the uh icicu bank or it can be in a CD Bank


00:04:09
okay so you can use an IBM mq uh to make sure the transaction information gets sent securely and reliability uh between different mainframe computers involved in the transactions okay so that's a very simple way uh to tell oh how what is the IBM mq okay so how mqs are used in Mainframe in a Mainframe environment mq provides a way to integrate applications running on the Mainframe with applications running on different platforms so it can be like a distributed systems Click mobile or it can be in a cloud okay so mq can be used in many ways for example if you want to use it to integrate a legacy application system running on the Mainframe with a modern application running on different other platforms so it it can it can be used too okay and it can also be used to manage transactions across multiple systems or to provide reliable messaging between two different applications or it can be in many


00:05:10
different applications so that's how the mq can be used on a mainframe system so how to use mq on Mainframe okay to use mq on the Mainframe you need to install and configure the mq software that is ibmq software Define the cues and write the programs to receive the message or to send the message or we call it as put and get message from the queues so the mq API provides that enables the program running on the Mainframe to communicate with mq and exchange message with other application so that message can be sent or received in a different formats that is like a text binary or an XML format okay so let's take a simple example so assume that you have a Cobalt program running on the mainframe system and you want to send a message from the mainframe system to a Java or Windows system so which is using a Java program or it can be in a C sharp program so what are the steps


00:06:10
involved now so first thing is you need to create a queue manager on the maintenance system and how this is achieved it is you using an IBM mq administrative tool so there there you can Define one queue for this message transfer from Mainframe to Java system or a Windows Server right yeah so then for after creating a queue so you need to define a queue on the mainframe system and again you will be using IBM administrative mq admin studio tool that will be defined that temporary queue so where all the requests will be stored in that queue okay then you will be writing a Cobalt program to send a message and then you create a channel on Windows server and you'll be defining a queue similar to the Mainframe on the receiver side that is on the Windows server side and then you will be having a Java program that receives the messages and it uses mq API to receive these messages I name the COBOL also Cobalt uses the mq API there as well okay so let's look at the simple


00:07:11
locoball program so how it is written so so here we'll be specifying all the details related to the mq so it can be in a queue manager so as I said like first we need to define the queue and the queue name and the hostname where that queue with that mq is located and the port number and the different Channel what is the channel name that is being used and what is the message that you want to pass so here it is a simple hello world so but in the real time so it can be any it's it can be in a bank money transfer or it can be a transaction or anything it can be the message can be anything so that that would be the message but these are the key information that we need to know and this involves various steps so it starts from uh mq connection uh then mq open mq put mq close so this these are the different various steps that are involved so that would be the process I can say first it has to connect then it has to open then it has to put some message uh


00:08:15
to transfer and then after that the connection would be closed so this is a simple Cobalt program that is using an mq okay now let's let's look at the real time examples of a in different domains how this I I mean mqs are used okay if I talk about the banking so mqs are used to transfer a real-time data between core banking systems it can be in a deposit it can be a lending or any kind of assistance okay so especially the co-banking uh so transfer is used to transfer Real Time real time data between core banking system and other banking applications such as ATMs Mobile Banking and internet banking okay so let's look at the health care mq is used to transfer sensitive Health data between different Healthcare applications such as electronic health record systems clinical decision support systems and live laboratory information management system okay what about retail it is used to integrate point of sale


00:09:17
system with back-end Inventory management system enabling real-time updates and product availability and pricing and Telecommunications uh mq is used to integrate calls into systems with customer relationship management system enabling real-time access to customer data for customer service Representatives and let's look at the government uh in government also it is used for tax collection systems or it can be in a welfare systems or voter registration system enabling real-time data exchange and collaboration between different agencies so and you can see like uh by looking at these examples right so you can imagine or you can understand like how uh a major key role that IBM mq plays in the day-to-day technology world right yeah so let me summarize all the different uh examples that we have seen uh so in Banking and Financial application this


00:10:18
is used for mqs or used for money transfers and uh online banking and securities trading uh in Supply Chain management systems for real-time communication of logistics and inventory data Healthcare systems for patients data exchange and communication between different Healthcare organization in retail systems for communication between stores warehouse and distribution centers government and public sector systems for secure communication of sensitive data telecommunication system for real-time communication of call and data traffic transportation systems for communication between Planes Trains and Automobiles at Industrial Systems for control and communication and Manufacturing process and Powerful Industries right so this was a quick summary on how mq is used in the different domains or different techno different different application systems okay yeah so this


00:11:18
was a brief overview of IBM mq and how it is especially used in the mainframe system I hope this has given a little information about of high IBM mq so if you if you were not aware of anything about the IBM mq sorry I feel like this might have came in UA good information and then this guy this can be in a starting point for you and then if you are really working on IBM mq so then you can go ahead and get started on working on it okay so yeah so it's not that when you're when you're working on a Mainframe systems it's it's not just like learning a Cobalt GCL db2cis we need to learn all the integration systems as well we need to learn uh different things that are involved in the mainframes right so IBM mq plays a very key role on the Mainframe systems okay so just thought like let me share on these as well so that's the reason I've created this video okay okay that's it guys uh thank you so much
